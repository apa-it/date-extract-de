SYNOPSIS

        use Date::Extract::DE;
        my $parser = Date::Extract::DE->new( reference_date => $reference_date );
        my $dates = $parser->extract($text);

DESCRIPTION

    This is a module to extract dates from german text (similar to
    Date::Extract).

METHODS

    new(reference_date => $reference_date, lookback_days => $lookback_days)

      Creates a new instance. Optionally, you can specify a reference
      Date::Simple which is used to determine the year when a date is given
      incompletely in the text (default is today). You can also specify a
      maximum numer of days to look back when an incomplete date is guessed
      (otherwise the closest date is used)

    extract($text)

      Tries to extract dates from the text and returns an arrayref of
      Date::Simple instances

    extract_with_context($text)

      Tries to extract dates from the text and returns an arrayref of
      HashRef instances. Each HashRef contains a key 'date' which maps to a
      Date::Simple instance, and a key 'context' mapping to the date string
      found in the original text
